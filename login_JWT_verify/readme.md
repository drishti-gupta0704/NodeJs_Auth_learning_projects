# JWT Verification Project 

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates **JSON Web Token (JWT) based authentication.  
It focuses on generating JWT tokens during login and **verifying tokens** to protect secure API routes.

JWT is commonly used in modern backend systems for **stateless authentication**, making this project highly relevant for real-world applications and interviews.
